Prototype for Touch Matrix Assistive Technology Navigator (TOMAT)


# Overview
“Touch Matrix Assistive Technology Navigator” (tomat navigator) is an affordable, open-source assistive technology that uses AI and tactile technologies to make it easier and more natural for visually impaired users to navigate the internet. It works as a companion device for screen readers, providing an interactive non-visual representation of a webpage through audio-tactile feedback. It was codesigned with and for visually impaired screen reader users.

# Intellectual Property Strategy

## Commitment to Open Innovation with Strategic Protection

Our team remains commited to our mission to advance assistive technology through open collaboration. To balance innovation protection with community growth, we've implemented a **phased intellectual property strategy** guided by [Axelys](https://www.axelys.ca/en/), Quebec's nonprofit expert in research commercialization and technology transfer.

### Current Licensing Framework (Phase 1)
[![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY--NC--SA_4.0-EF9421.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

**Temporary License:** Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International  

**Key Provisions:**
- ✅ **Permitted:**  
  - Academic research & non-commercial use  
  - Prototyping & personal adaptation  
  - Educational implementations  

- ⚠️ **Restricted Without Written Consent:**  
  - Commercial distribution or integration  
  - Forking for proprietary development  
  - Patent filings derived from this work  

**Full License Text:** [LICENSE.txt](/LICENSE.txt)

> External contributions will require CLA to facilitate relicensing. 

### Transition Roadmap to Full Open Source (Phase 2)

**Target License:** CERN-OHL-P v2 or Apache 2.0 (or equivalent)  

**Transition Triggers:**  
1. Completion of Axelys' technology assessment (AXE-0431: completed on summer 2024)
2. Establishment of sustainable funding model (ongoing)

**Declaration of intention:** All core contributors have declared their intention to open-source release through our [Open Source Release Agreement](/docs/open-source%20release%20agreement.pdf).

### Why This Approach?

1. **Protection During Development**  
   Prevents patent trolling while enabling academic collaboration during critical R&D phases.

2. **Sustainable Commercialization**  
   Allows time to establish ethical commercialization partnerships that will fund ongoing development.

3. **Community Safeguards**  
   Ensures derivative works remain accessible to visually impaired users through copyleft provisions.

### How This Affects You

**Researchers & Educators:**  
- Full access to current implementations  
- Ability to publish papers/case studies (with attribution)  
- Pathway for collaborative grants  

**Developers:**  
- Protected right to fork upon full open-source release  
- Clear timeline for commercial participation  

**End Users:**  
- Guaranteed perpetual access to assistive innovations  
- Protection from proprietary lock-in
